<h1> Hobby's</h1>
<ul>
    <li> Fitness:
        <p> At some point I use to go to the gym when I had time for it. Just lifting weights and doing some cardio to <br>
            increase strength and health. I have done this in the <a href="https://www.basic-fit.com/nl-be/home">basic-fit</a>
            in different locations. </p> </li>

    <li> Gaming:
        <p> I have been a gamer for a bit. I have played <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us">Minecraft</a>
            for a while. I have played more than one version of <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/gta-v" >GTA</a> but,
            GTA Vice City was my favourite.
        </p> </li>
    <li> Watching anime:
        <p> I still do watch anime, like last Saturday I have watched the new episode of Bleach. If I have time this week, I <br>
            will watch the new episodes of re zero. Best web that gathers anime information is <a href="https://myanimelist.net/"
